 * Override CSS
 * 
 * This file is intentionally empty and provided as a placeholder for user customizations.
 * 
 * Users can create an override.css file in their project root at:
 *   assets/css/override.css
 * 
 * This file will be loaded last in the CSS bundle, allowing you to override
 * any theme styles without modifying the theme files directly.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 *   .post-card {
 *     border-radius: 8px;
 *   }
 * 
 *   :root {
 *     --primary-color: #custom-color;
 *   }
